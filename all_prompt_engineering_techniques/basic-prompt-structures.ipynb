        "# Basic Prompt Structures Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial focuses on two fundamental types of prompt structures:\n",
        "1. Single-turn prompts\n",
        "2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use OpenAI's GPT model and LangChain to demonstrate these concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding different prompt structures is crucial for effective communication with AI models. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, straightforward queries, while multi-turn prompts enable more complex, context-aware interactions. Mastering these structures allows for more versatile and effective use of AI in various applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single-turn Prompts**: One-shot interactions with the language model.\n",
        "2. **Multi-turn Prompts**: Series of interactions that maintain context.\n",
        "3. **Prompt Templates**: Reusable structures for consistent prompting.\n",
        "4. **Conversation Chains**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use a combination of OpenAI's API and LangChain library to demonstrate these prompt structures. The tutorial will include practical examples and comparisons of different prompt types."

        "1. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, isolated queries.\n",
        "2. Multi-turn prompts maintain context across a conversation, allowing for more complex interactions.\n",
